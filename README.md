# Blink
### Bluetooth Linux Remote for Android devices

Where you want to be able to control your Linux Computer, and Wifi is not an option. This is something I wrote, because nothing else on the market seemed to work.

### Get the app on the Android AppStore:
[todo] Provide link

### Get the Server:
Follow the instructions to get the server on it's dedicated GitHub page: https://github.com/drpain/blink-server

And enjoy!
